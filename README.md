# Music Mood App

## Intro

This is the source code for the iOS app that plays music to your mood through the Spotify API. App coded in xcode and vs code then pushed into git 

I will be using GitHub Actions for CI

## CI/CD

### CI

Continuous Integration (CI) describes how individuals within a team merge local code changes into the main branch repository as often as possible. Changes are validated by creating a build and running automated tests against the build.

### CD

Continuous deployment (CD) adds to Continuous delivery by pushing all built code to production environments through automated deployments. This means that the changes are released to others automatically after code is integrated as long as it passes certain tests which can be automated.

I will be using Continuous deployment to push the built app to Apple testflight.

## CI/CD Benifits

### CI benefits

Integration takes less effort as integrating smaller changers takes less time. Issues with code will come up earlier which are easier to fix. Automation means less issues as unit tests can find problems. The process of the repository is more visible which in turn improves team collaboration. Short integration iterations offer more flexibility and finally the code is ready to be delivered more often.
CD benefits

### CD benefits

Releasing takes less effort as deployments can be automated. Releasing is more: reliable and repeatable as pipelines are a set process which is followed every time. This puts control of releases in the hands of the team, which in turn improves collaboration. Releasing more often also means feedback from customers quicker.

### GitHub Benifits

GitHub Actions help you automate tasks within your software development life cycle by defining a workflow within GitHub. It is a solution which incorporates tools to store within a GitHub repository, build and deploy software. 

GitHub Actions are event-driven, meaning that you can run a series of commands after a specified event has occurred. For example, every time someone creates a pull request for a repository, you can automatically run a command that executes a software testing script.
